# TRIAGE

TRIAGE is a simple, customisable knowledge base app.

#### THE IDEA

Triage is inspired by:

- **Tech-heavy workplaces where staff might not be highly tech-skilled, but have to troubleshoot in high-pressure situations**

An example:

- A TV journalist, in the newsroom or in the field, has to meet tight deadlines and use a diverse and often unique combo of technologies

- The journalist might not have the technical expertise to be comfortable troubleshooting without guidance

- But the solutions are sometimes straightforward

- The journalist might not have a user guide, but they are likely to be on a web browser**

- Technical staff might also need to spend their time on more complex issues

Both sides would benefit from a simple but customisable knowledge base.

Simple, for rapid access to the most important info.

Customisable, to suit unique combos of tech implemented in different workplaces.
